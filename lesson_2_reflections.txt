--What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- git setups the directory creating the .git subdir and architecture for tracking history. It doesnt add tracked files or an initial commit.

New concepts:
working directory: actual system dir where you work
staging area: git area where to place files to be committed choosen from working dir
git init: setups a directory as a git repository
git status: shows commit status of staging area\working directory
git add: add a file from working dir to staging area


--How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- Staging area is a setup area for git commits, where you can identify what files to commit. 
It helps separating files, preventing full workdir commits. 
It's the necessary infrastructure for logic commits.
