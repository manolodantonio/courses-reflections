--When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-to share with other people and have a common repository. Also for cloud backup.

--Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-So i can decide when to update my public project in a way other people can always use it in a coherent way, not an half-built project.

--Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Clone copies a repository from a source on your local. 
Fork is the same, but on GitHub servers, adding linkback and visibility to the clone. 
Branch is a copy that can be created inside a repository to modify it without afflicting the original.
